# Squrily 
This is a very starter pack platformer game that I am just using to learn the Godot 4.2.1 editor. 
The main point of this game is to put your nuts down the hole in the middle of the level floor.
After all the nuts in a level have been stuffed in the hole the player achieves the kill screen. -needs to be implimented.   
After achievement of a kill screen a players time is counted and they proceed to the next level. -needs to be implimented.   
After all the levels have been completed a player achieves the main end kill screen. -needs to be implimented.   
There is a timer that counts how long the player has played the game. -needs to be implimented.  
After a certain ammount of time passes the death screen is activated. -needs to be implimented.  
Taking too long to complete alevel takes time away from the time alloted to complete future levels. -needs to be implimented.  
There are time coins scattered around the levels that can add more time to the clock and allow a player to have more time to complete future levels and the current level. -needs to be implimented.  
Players have 3 squrils at the start of the game and can get extra squrils to prolong their attempt to complete the game. -needs to be implimented.  
Nuts add to the players score. -needs to be implimented.  
Completing a level adds to the players score. -needs to be implimented.  
Completing a level without being harmed or dieing adds to the players score. -needs to be implimented.  
When a nut gets pushed down the hole sparks and particals fly out of the hole. -needs to be implimented.  
While a character attempts to aquire all the nuts in time there are enemies that attack the player and try to cause the player to waist time and use up all their extra squrils. -needs to be implimented.
